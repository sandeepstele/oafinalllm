Detailed Document for Each Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) Score for Osteoarthritis

Introduction

The Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) grading system is one of the most widely used radiographic classification methods for osteoarthritis. Originally described in 1957, it uses plain radiographs (typically anteroposterior views of the knee or other joints) to assign one of five grades (0–4) reflecting the severity of joint degeneration. Radiographic features—such as joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, subchondral sclerosis, and bone-end deformity—correlate with increasing disease severity. Although the system was designed for epidemiological studies and clinical trials, it remains a useful tool in guiding clinical decision-making.

Below is a breakdown of each KL grade.

KL Grade 0 – Normal

Radiographic Features
	•	Definition: No radiographic features of osteoarthritis.
	•	Findings:
	•	Normal joint space.
	•	Absence of osteophytes (bone spurs).
	•	No subchondral sclerosis or cyst formation.

Clinical Correlation
	•	Symptoms: Patients are typically asymptomatic with no OA-related pain or stiffness.
	•	Implications: Radiographs are normal, and any joint pain would prompt further investigation for non-degenerative causes.

Management
	•	Approach: No specific OA treatment is indicated. Preventative advice regarding joint health (e.g., maintaining a healthy weight and regular exercise) can be recommended.

KL Grade 1 – Doubtful

Radiographic Features
	•	Definition: Doubtful joint space narrowing and possible osteophytic lipping.
	•	Findings:
	•	Joint space appears normal or shows minimal narrowing.
	•	Very small or “doubtful” osteophytes may be present.
	•	No definite subchondral sclerosis or bone deformity.

Clinical Correlation
	•	Symptoms: Patients might be asymptomatic or have very mild discomfort. The changes are subtle.
	•	Implications: This grade suggests the earliest signs of degenerative change, but the clinical significance is often limited. It may be considered “doubtful” OA.

Management
	•	Approach: Monitoring is typically recommended. Lifestyle modifications (e.g., weight management and exercise) can be advised to prevent progression.
	•	Follow-Up: Repeat radiographs over time may be used to assess progression if symptoms develop.

Reference:  ￼;  ￼

KL Grade 2 – Mild

Radiographic Features
	•	Definition: Definite osteophyte formation with possible joint space narrowing.
	•	Findings:
	•	Clear osteophytes (bone spurs) are visible at the joint margins.
	•	Joint space narrowing may be present, though not always pronounced.
	•	Subchondral sclerosis is typically minimal or absent.
	•	Bone contour remains mostly preserved.

Clinical Correlation
	•	Symptoms: Patients may start experiencing intermittent joint pain or stiffness, especially after activity.
	•	Implications: KL Grade 2 represents early osteoarthritis with definite structural changes. It often correlates with the beginning of symptomatic OA in some individuals.

Management
	•	Approach: Conservative treatment is recommended—lifestyle modifications, physical therapy, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be useful.
	•	Goals: The focus is on symptom relief and delaying further progression.

*Reference:  ￼; *

KL Grade 3 – Moderate

Radiographic Features
	•	Definition: Moderate multiple osteophytes, definite joint space narrowing, some sclerosis, and possible deformity of bone ends.
	•	Findings:
	•	Numerous osteophytes are present.
	•	Clear and definite narrowing of the joint space.
	•	Subchondral sclerosis (increased bone density beneath the cartilage) is evident.
	•	Early signs of bone-end deformity may appear.

Clinical Correlation
	•	Symptoms: Patients typically report persistent joint pain, stiffness (especially after periods of inactivity), and reduced range of motion.
	•	Implications: This grade often corresponds to clinically significant OA with moderate functional impairment. There is a more noticeable impact on daily activities.

Management
	•	Approach: In addition to conservative treatments (exercise, weight reduction, pain medications), interventions such as physical therapy and possibly intra-articular injections (e.g., corticosteroids) may be considered.
	•	Goals: The aim is to improve joint function, relieve pain, and slow progression to more severe changes.

Reference:  ￼;  ￼

KL Grade 4 – Severe

Radiographic Features
	•	Definition: Large osteophytes, marked narrowing of the joint space, severe sclerosis, and definite deformity of bone ends.
	•	Findings:
	•	Extensive and large osteophyte formation.
	•	Marked and often near-complete loss of joint space (sometimes described as “bone-on-bone” contact).
	•	Severe subchondral sclerosis.
	•	Clear deformity of the bone ends.

Clinical Correlation
	•	Symptoms: Patients frequently experience severe and constant pain, significant stiffness, and considerable functional impairment. Daily activities are usually affected.
	•	Implications: This stage represents end-stage OA where structural damage is extensive. It is typically associated with advanced symptoms and may prompt consideration of surgical intervention.

Management
	•	Approach: When severe OA is present, conservative treatments may no longer provide sufficient relief. Options include joint replacement surgery (e.g., total knee arthroplasty) and other advanced interventions.
	•	Goals: The focus is on restoring function and relieving pain, as well as improving quality of life.



This serious, painful condition is the most common form of arthritis and can affect any joint.

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that can affect the many tissues of the joint. It is by far the most common form of arthritis, affecting more than 32.5 million adults in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Historically, osteoarthritis (OA) was known as a “wear and tear” condition, generally associated with aging. But we know now that it is a disease of the entire joint, including bone, cartilage, ligaments, fat and the tissues lining the joint (the synovium). Osteoarthritis can degrade cartilage, change bone shape and cause inflammation, resulting in pain, stiffness and loss of mobility.

OA can affect any joint, but typically affects hands, knees, hips, lower back and neck. Its signs and symptoms typically show up more often in individuals over age 50, but OA can affect much younger people, too, especially those who have had a prior joint injury, such as a torn ACL or meniscus. It typically develops slowly over time, but after such an injury, it can develop much more rapidly, within just a few years. OA is not an inevitable aging disease; some people never develop it.

There is no cure for OA, but there are ways to manage OA to minimize pain, continue physical activities, maintain a good quality of life and remain mobile.

Causes


Factors that may contribute to the development of OA include 

Age. The risk of developing OA increases with age and symptoms generally, but not always, appear in people over 50. 
Joint injury. A bone fracture or cartilage or ligament tear can lead to OA, sometimes more quickly than in cases where there is not an obvious injury.
Overuse. Using the same joints over and over in a job or sport can result in OA.
Obesity. Excess weight adds stress and pressure on a joint, plus fats cells promote inflammation.
Musculoskeletal abnormalities. Malalignment of bone or joint structures can contribute to faster development of OA.
Weak muscles. If muscles don’t provide adequate joint support, poor alignment can result, which can lead to OA.
Genetics. People with family members who have OA are more likely to develop it.
Gender. Women are more likely to develop OA than men.
Environmental Factors. Modifiable environmental risk factors include things like someone’s occupation, level of physical activity, quadriceps strength, presence or absence of prior joint injury, obesity, diet, sex hormones, and bone density.
Symptoms


Symptoms tend to build over time rather than show up suddenly. They include

Pain or aching in a joint during activity, after long activity or at the end of the day.
Joint stiffness usually occurs first thing in the morning or after resting.
Limited range of motion that may go away after movement.
Clicking or popping sound when a joint bends.
Swelling around a joint.
Muscle weakness around the joint.
Joint instability or buckling (as when a knee gives out).
OA may affect different parts of the body in different ways.

Hips. Pain in the groin area or buttocks and sometimes on the inside of the knee or thigh.
Knees. A “grating” or “scraping” feeling when moving the knee. 
Fingers. Bony growths (spurs) at the edge of joints can cause fingers to become swollen, tender and red, sometimes with pain at the base of the thumb.
Feet. Pain and tenderness in the big toe, with possible swelling in the ankles or toes.
Potential Consequences


Pain, reduced mobility, side effects from medications and other factors associated with osteoarthritis can lead to health complications that are not caused by the disease itself.

Obesity, Diabetes and Heart Disease

Painful joints, especially in the feet, ankles, knees, hip or back, make it harder to exercise. But physical activity is not only key to managing OA symptoms, it also can help prevent weight gain, which can lead to obesity. Being overweight or obese can lead to the development of high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. 

Falls

Research indicates people with OA experience more falls and risk of fracture than those without OA. Although study results vary, some research shows they may have up to 30% more falls and have a 20% greater risk of fracture. Having OA can decrease function, weaken muscles, affect overall balance, and make falls more likely, especially among those with OA in knees or hips. Side effects from pain medications, such as dizziness, can also contribute to falls.

Diagnosis


Medical history, a physical examination and lab tests help to make up the OA diagnosis. 

A primary care doctor may be the first person you talk to about joint pain. The doctor will review your medical history, symptoms, how the pain affects activities, as well as your medical problems and medication use. He or she will also look at and move your joints, and may order imaging. These tests help to make the diagnosis:

Joint aspiration. After numbing the area, a needle is inserted into the joint to pull out fluid. This test will look for infection or crystals in the fluid to help rule out other medical conditions or other forms of arthritis.
X-ray. X-rays can show joint or bone damage or changes related to osteoarthritis.
MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) gives a better view of cartilage and other parts of the joint.
Treatment


There is no cure for OA, but medication, assistive devices and other therapies that don’t involve drugs can help to ease pain. As a last resort, a damaged joint may be surgically fused or replaced with one made of a combination of metal, plastic and/or ceramic. 

Medications

Pain and anti-inflammatory medicines for osteoarthritis are available as pills, syrups, patches, gels, creams or injectables. They include:  

Analgesics. These are pain relievers and include acetaminophen and opioids. Acetaminophen is available over the counter (OTC); opioids must be prescribed by a doctor.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These are the most commonly used drugs to ease inflammation and pain. They include aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and celecoxib, available either OTC or by prescription. The OTC versions help with pain but not inflammation.
Counterirritants. These OTC products contain ingredients like capsaicin, menthol and lidocaine that irritate nerve endings, so the painful area feels cold, warm or itchy to take focus away from the actual pain. 
Corticosteroids. These prescription anti-inflammatory medicines work in a similar way to a hormone called cortisol. The medicine is taken by mouth or injected into the joint at a doctor’s office.
Platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Available from a doctor by injection, this product is intended to help ease pain and inflammation. This is not approved by the Food & Drug Administration and evidence is still emerging, so discuss it with your doctor before trying it.
Other drugs. The antidepressant duloxetine (Cymbalta) and the anti-seizure drug pregabalin (Lyrica) are oral medicines that are FDA-approved to treat OA pain.
Nondrug Therapies

Exercise

Movement is an essential part of an OA treatment plan. Getting 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise per week should be the goal, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A good exercise program to fight OA pain and stiffness has four parts:

Strengthening exercises build muscles around painful joints and helps to ease the stress on them. 
Range-of-motion exercise or stretching helps to reduce stiffness and keep joints moving.
Aerobic or cardio exercises help improve stamina and energy levels and reduce excess weight.
Balance exercises help strengthen small muscles around the knees and ankles and help prevent falls.
Talk to a doctor or physical therapist before starting a new exercise program.

Weight Loss

Excess weight puts additional force and stress on weight-bearing joints, including the hips, knees, ankles, feet and back, and fat cells promote inflammation. Losing extra weight helps reduce pain and slow joint damage. Every pound of weight lost removes four pounds of pressure on lower-body joints.

Physical Therapies and Assistive Devices
Physical therapists, occupational therapists and chiropractors can provide:

Specific exercises to help stabilize your joints and ease pain.
Information about natural treatments and products that can ease pain.
Instruction to make movement easier and to protect joints. 
Braces, shoe inserts or other assistive devices.
Surgery

Joint surgery can improve pain and function. Joint replacement surgery replaces damaged joints to restore mobility and relieve pain. Hips and knees are the joints most commonly replaced. An orthopedic surgeon can determine the best procedure based on how badly damaged the joint is.

Self-Care


Practicing these habits can slow down OA, keep you healthier overall and delay surgery as long as possible. It is important to pursue a number of different self-care approaches simultaneously. They are listed below.

Maintain a Healthy Weight

Excess weight worsens OA. Combine healthy eating with regular exercise to maintain a healthy weight.

Control Blood Sugar

Many people have diabetes and OA. Having high glucose levels can make cartilage stiffer and more likely to break down. Having diabetes causes inflammation, which also weakens cartilage.

Maintain Range of Motion

Movement is medicine for joints. Make a habit of putting your joints through their full range of motion, but only up to the point where it doesn’t cause more pain. Gentle stretching, raising and lowering legs from a standing or seated position, daily walks and hobbies such as gardening can help. But listen to your body and never push too hard.

Protect Joints

Make sure to warm up and cool down when doing exercise. If you play sports, protects joints with the right gear. Use your largest, strongest joints for lifting, pushing, pulling and carrying. Watch your step to prevent falls. Balance rest and activity throughout the day.  

Relax

Find ways to reduce or avoid stress through meditation, listening to music, connecting with friends and family, doing fun activities, and finding ways to relax and recharge.

Choose a Healthy Lifestyle

Eating healthy food, balanced nutrition, not smoking, drinking in moderation and getting good sleep will help you to feel your best.

History
Osteoarthritis (OA) ranks globally among the 50 most
common sequelae of diseases and injuries, affecting over
250 million people or 4% of the world’s population [39].
Of the global disease burden for OA, knee OA constitutes
83% [39]. A detailed analysis of Medicare beneficiaries
reported the TKA annual utilization rate ranging from
287,006 in 2006 to 301,956 in 2010 [26]. The demand for
TKA is expected to grow exponentially over the coming
decades with epidemiological data suggesting a 673%
increase in the United States by 2030, representing 3.48
million procedures annually [22].
As a polymorphic disease with a variety of clinical
presentations, OA is challenging to rigorously define. A
commonly encountered definition of OA describes ‘‘…a
heterogeneous group of conditions that leads to joint
symptoms and signs which are associated with defective
integrity of articular cartilage, in addition to related
changes in the underlying bone and at the joint margins’’
[1]. The pathogenesis of OA is poorly understood but is
thought to include a complex interplay among mechanical,
biochemical, cellular, genetic, and immunologic phenomena
[7]. Several attempts to develop diagnostic criteria for
OA were previously undertaken and incorporate patientreported
joint pain in conjunction with consistent radiographic
findings [1, 6, 24]. OA generally can be
subcategorized into primary (idiopathic) and secondary OA
[1, 25]. Common causes of secondary OA include posttraumatic,
dysplastic, infectious, inflammatory, or
biochemical etiologies that are relatively well understood.
Although the etiology of primary OA remains largely
undefined, genetic factors, age-related physiological
changes, ethnicity, and biomechanical factors likely play
an important role [16].
Plain radiography remains a mainstay in the diagnosis of
OA. The first formalized attempts at establishing a radiographic
classification scheme for OA were described by
Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) in 1957 [19]. After studying
rheumatism in coal miners at the Bedford Colliery in North
West England [18], Kellgren investigated the inter- and
intraobserver reliability of radiographic changes of
rheumatism observed in the hand [17]. After concluding
that there was wide disagreement among different observers,
KL endeavored to establish a classification
scheme with an associated set of standardized radiographs
for OA of diarthrodial joints. They proposed a five-grade
classification scheme and examined plain radiographs of
eight joints including the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP),
metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP), first carpometacarpal
joint (CMC), wrist, cervical spine, lumbar spine, hips, and
knees to calculate the inter- and intraobserver reliability of
each [19]. They found that the tibiofemoral joint of the
knee had the highest interobserver correlation coefficient of
r = 0.83 (range of all joints studied, 0.10–0.83) as well as
the second highest intraobserver correlation coefficient of

r = 0.83 (range of all joints studied, 0.42–0.88) among the
diarthrodial joints they examined [19]. These early results
would predict the future application of their classification
scheme to the knee specifically. Currently, the KL classification
is the most widely used clinical tool for the
radiographic diagnosis of OA [5].
Purpose
The KL classification has been commonly used as a research
tool in epidemiological studies of OA, including landmark
articles by Felson et al. [10] in the Framingham
Osteoarthritis Study, and Bagge et al. [3] assessing
osteoarthritis in European populations. The KL classification
was also used in the development of atlases of radiographic
features of OA, including the work done by Scott et al. [33].
The Kellgren and Lawrence classification may also
assist healthcare providers with a treatment algorithm to
guide clinical decision-making, specifically defining which
patients may benefit most from surgical management.
Furthermore, some insurers currently require providers to
include documentation of the KL classification to receive
approval for a TKA [37, 38].
Despite its common use, all research and clinical efforts
using the KL classification depend critically on rigorous
validation and continuous reevaluation of the schema’s
relevance to patient-centered outcomes.
Description of the Kellgren-Lawrence Classification
System
Based on the data presented in their original work, the KL
classification is typically applied specifically within the context
of knee OA. The KL classification was originally
described using AP knee radiographs. Each radiograph was
assigned a grade from 0 to 4, which they correlated to
increasing severity of OA, with Grade 0 signifying no presence
of OA and Grade 4 signifying severe OA [19] (Fig. 1).
Additionally, KL provided detailed radiographic descriptions
ofOA(Table 1).Although it is unclear fromthe original paper
whether the radiographic descriptionswere presentedwith the
intent of demonstrating a linear disease progression ofOAthat
begins with the formation of osteophytes and culminates in the
altered shape of bone ends, other authors have criticized the
KL system on the basis of this assumption [5, 27].
Validation
In their original paper, KL acknowledged variability in the
radiographic evaluation of OA and described the inter- and
intraobserver reliability of their system [19] (Table 2). In
particular, the authors comment that estimates of OA
prevalence in all joints examined vary considerably
between observers (± 31% deviation from the mean
number of diagnoses of OA) and less so within the same
observer (± 5% deviation from the mean number of
diagnoses of OA). The authors report the inter- and
intraobserver reliability correlation coefficient of the knee
to both be 0.83 and comment that, ‘‘A significant correlation
between the two observers was obtained for all joints
except the wrist’’ and ‘‘Two readings by the same observer
gave only a slightly better correlation on the reading of
individual x rays…’’ [19]. It is unlikely, however, that the
authors used the term ‘‘significant’’ within the same statistical
context that the word carries in the literature today
because no p values or confidence intervals were reported
for their data. To determine the inter- and intraobserver
correlation coefficients, KL used two observers to evaluate
a series of 510 radiographs of eight joints including the
DIP, MCP, first CMC, wrist, cervical spine, lumbar spine,
hips, and knees from 85 patients aged 55 to 64 years
selected randomly from an urban population. The authors
did not explicitly report how many radiographs from each
joint were used in their calculations or mention the qualifications
or training of the two observers who graded the
radiographs.
More recently, Wright [40] reevaluated the interobserver
reliability of the KL system in addition to five other
radiographic classification schemes used to grade knee OA
(Table 3). The group used radiographs from 632 patients
enrolled in the Multicenter ACL Revision Study (MARS)
consortium, which consisted of cohorts of patients from 83
surgeons from 52 sites. The investigators used three independent
and blinded observers (specific qualifications and
training not explicitly stated by authors) to grade weightbearing
AP and/or Rosenberg radiographs (depending on
availability) with six radiographic classification schemes.
In addition, their radiographic findings were compared with
arthroscopic evidence of tibiofemoral chondral disease.
They reported that the KL system was the most studied
among the different classification systems and had an
interobserver reliability intraclass correlation coefficient of
0.51 to 0.89 (considered ‘‘moderate’’ to ‘‘very good’’ based
on the author’s provided definitions) from studies since the
original KL article [40]. The investigators provided their
own interobserver reliability intraclass correlation coefficients
using the Rosenberg radiograph 0.54 (95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.48–0.59) and AP radiographs
0.38 (95% CI, 0.33–0.43), which they characterized as
moderate and poor, respectively [40]. The authors provide
an explanation for this wide range in interobserver reliability
by suggesting that differences in technique,
population age group, and degree of OA likely contributed

123
to the differing results from the various studies. It is also
likely that variable interpretations of the KL classification
by observers in different studies had a considerable effect
on the reliability data they reported.
In the 1987 study of the Framingham population by
Felson et al. [10], the investigators had two academically
based bone and joint radiologists examine standing AP

radiographs of the knee of 1424 elderly patients (ages 63–
94 years old, mean = 73 years) and reported an interrater
intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.85 (‘‘very good’’)
using the KL classification. Although the study provided
unique population-based data using highly trained observers,
the authors admit that their population lacked ethnic
diversity by having no black, Hispanic, or non-European
ethnic groups. Given the growing ethnic diversity of the US
population, it may be difficult to extrapolate the results
found in this study to the broader population. In later works
by Scott et al. [33], the authors used two skeletal radiologists
and two rheumatologists to examine 30 standing AP
knee radiographs randomly selected by an investigator not
involved in the readings from the Baltimore Longitudinal
Study of Aging and reported an interreader intraclass correlation
coefficient of 0.68 (‘‘good’’) and intrareader
intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.87 (‘‘very good’’).
The authors do not provide detailed ethnic demographic
information about their study population but report that
their subjects consisted of 25 men and five women (ages
42–84 years old, mean age of men = 67 years, mean age of
women = 71 years). Both studies admit to selecting a
similar number of radiographs from each KL classification
grade for calculating their intraclass correlation coefficients,
which may provide more stable predictions of
reliability scores but may not be as readily applicable to
larger populations. Another study by Gossec et al. [12]
used 50 radiographs selected from 1759 radiographs from
five databases of trials or cohort studies to evaluate the
interreader and intrareader intraclass correlation coefficient
of standing, extended knee radiographs using two trained
rheumatologists and reported that the KL classification had
an interreader intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.72
(95% CI, 0.38–0.86) (‘‘good’’) and an intrareader intraclass
correlation coefficient of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.55–0.83)
(‘‘good’’). No criteria for the selection of the 50 radiographs
from the collection of 1759 were explicitly stated by
the authors and it is not clear if the selection included
relatively equal numbers of radiographs from each KL
classification grade. Given the differing demographic
makeup of each population studied, including differences
in ethnic group, percentage of male versus female, and age
as well as the differing selection criteria for the radiographs
examined by the observers, which themselves varied in
number, qualifications, and training, it is understandable
that the range of interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients
for the KL classification cited by Wright [40]
(0.51–0.89) is as wide as it is.
Although independent validation of the KL classification
has been examined by multiple authors, less is known
about the KL classification’s diagnostic accuracy, that is
the degree to which the radiographic findings actually
reflect the physical state of the joint; the best work on this
suggests that using the Rosenberg view (the 45  posteroanterior
flexion weightbearing radiograph; Fig. 2 [28])
results in higher interrater reliability (0.54; 95% CI, 0.48–
0.59) and better correlation to arthroscopic evidence of OA
(Spearman rho 0.42; 95% CI, 0.33–0.49) than does using
the AP radiograph (interrater reliability 0.38; 95% CI,
0.33–0.43; Spearman rho 0.30; 95% CI, 0.23–0.38) [40].
Those authors argue that this may be because the Rosenberg
radiograph provides better visualization of the femoral
condyles in midflexion, a common site of articular surface
degeneration.
Limitations
Despite the wide application of the KL classification, the
system has several noted limitations. Perhaps the most
widely argued criticism of the KL system is its application
to disease progression and insensitivity to change. The KL
system has been criticized by Spector and Cooper [35] for
assuming a linear radiographic progression of OA, starting
with osteophyte formation, proceeding to joint space narrowing
(JSN), and terminating in deformation of articular
surfaces. However, as the authors point out, JSN in the
absence of osteophyte formation cannot be measured in the
KL system, which becomes problematic in patients with

knee pain and radiographically evident loss of cartilage but
a lack of osteophytes on their knee radiographs. Although
this occurrence is thought to be less common, the presence
of marginal osteophytes likely represents a hypertrophic
response to mechanical stress in conjunction with
enchondral ossification, which may occur along a spectrum
depending on individual physiology [21]. Other classification
systems have attempted to segregate the radiological
findings by performing individual evaluations of the joint
space for the medial and lateral compartments separately
and doing likewise again for osteophyte formation in each
location [2, 5, 27, 34]. However, these classification systems
have not been adopted widely, likely as a result of
challenges in standardizing definitions and an inherent
difficulty in discriminating JSN and osteophyte formation.
In addition, Gu¨nther and Sun [13] described inferior
interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients for medial
compartment (0.62) and lateral compartment (0.47) JSN as
well as medial femorotibial, lateral femorotibial, and tibial
spine osteophyte formation (0.75, 0.74, and 0.63, respectively)
as compared with the overall KL classification score
(0.81) when using three observers, one of whom was an
experienced orthopaedic surgeon and two of whom were
orthopaedic residents. As discussed by Emrani et al. [8],
classifications based on JSN may be preferable to the KL
system for monitoring progression of OA, whereas the KL
system may be better for assessing severity of osteoarthritic
disease. A criticism of multiple classification systems (including
the KL) is the lack of recognition of patellofemoral
arthritis as a distinct or contributory radiographic factor.
Another criticism of the KL system is the inconsistency
in its original description by the authors and variable
applications of the classification in subsequent studies. In
their original paper, KL provided simple descriptions of
each grade, ‘‘none, doubtful, minimal, moderate, severe,’’
along with radiographic features considered evidence of
OA [19] (Table 1); however, they never explicitly specified
which radiographic features correspond to which grade.
Years after their original article, Grade 2 was changed to
‘‘the presence of definite osteophytes with minimal joint
space narrowing’’ [20]. After that, Grade 2 was changed
again to ‘‘definite osteophytes but the joint space is
unimpaired’’ [23]. These conflicting descriptions, although
they were not present in the initial paper or made by its
original authors, have nonetheless led to substantial confusion
among investigators and inconsistent application.
Schiphof et al. [30] examined epidemiological cohort
studies between 1966 and 2006 that incorporated the
original KL criteria and found five different descriptions of
the KL grading system. Interestingly, some cohort studies
contained inconsistencies within the same article. They
later examined the impact of these differences in descriptions
of the KL criteria [31] by having two trained readers
examine the weightbearing, extended, AP knee radiographs
of 3071 people using the five unique descriptions. The
authors calculated reproducibility, agreement using the j
statistic, and association with patient-reported knee complaints.
They determined that the reproducibility of three of
the descriptions was ‘‘good’’ (weighted j = 0.66, 0.69,
0.63), whereas the reproducibility of the original description
and a fifth description was ‘‘moderate’’ and ‘‘poor’’
(weighted j = 0.41 and 0.35, respectively). The authors
determined the agreement between the original KL criteria
and the four alternatives to be ‘‘moderate’’ (weighted j
approximately 0.50). The correlation to patient-reported
knee complaints was the strongest with the original
description (odds ratio [OR], 2.2 [95% CI, 1.9–2.7], 4.3
[95% CI, 3.2–5.7], 18.3 [95% CI, 7.1–47.2] at Grade[1,
Grade[2, Grade[3, respectively); however, the differences
in OR between the original and alternative
descriptions were small and sometimes not significant [31].
Additionally, the authors admit that patient-reported knee
complaints could be influenced by the presence of patellofemoral
OA, which is not taken into account with the KL
system and must be contextualized when interpreting this
data. The authors conclude their article with recommendations
for using the original description to differentiate
patients categorized as Grade[2 (definite/mild OA) from
patients categorized as Grade\2 (none/possible OA) and
to use several of the alternative descriptions to differentiate
patients categorize as Grade 0 (no OA) from patients categorized
as Grade 1 (possible OA). Given these results, it is
clear that discrepancies in the description and application
of the KL system are present in the literature; however, the
exact impact of these differences on patient care is unclear
and requires further investigation.
Conclusions and Uses
Although the KL system has limitations, it remains widely
used in clinical practice and in research. Like any radiographic
classification tool, the KL system is used ideally in
conjunction with a thorough clinical assessment. Altman
et al. [1] proposed criteria combining the medical history,
physical examination, laboratory as well as radiographic
tests to diagnose knee OA, an approach that provides a
more comprehensive assessment of a patient’s disease state
in comparison to the KL system alone.
Radiographic classification systems like KL seek to
standardize the interpretation of studies that many clinicians
order during an initial assessment of a patient
presenting with clinical findings suggestive of knee OA. In
their original paper, Kellgren and Lawrence intended to
create a standard reference for the radiographic evaluation
of OA for the purposes of field surveys and clinical trials.

Although the KL system has been validated with respect to
inter- and intraobserver reliability and a recent article
suggests high diagnostic accuracy [40], further research
applications should likely focus on the development of
treatment algorithms based on classification grade. Such
algorithms may better guide clinical decision-making
through an evidence-based approach.

Document 1: General Overview of Osteoarthritis and the KL Grading System

Introduction
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the gradual loss of cartilage, joint space narrowing, and changes in the underlying bone. It is the most common form of arthritis and is a major cause of pain and disability, particularly in older adults.

The Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) Grading System
Developed in 1957, the KL grading system is widely used to classify the severity of OA based on radiographic findings. It divides OA into five grades (0–4):
	•	KL Grade 0: Normal, with no radiographic features of OA.
	•	KL Grade 1: Doubtful, with subtle changes that might represent the very early onset of OA.
	•	KL Grade 2: Mild, with definite osteophyte formation and possible joint space narrowing.
	•	KL Grade 3: Moderate, with multiple osteophytes, clear joint space narrowing, and subchondral sclerosis.
	•	KL Grade 4: Severe, with large osteophytes, marked joint space loss, severe sclerosis, and bone deformity.

Clinical Correlations and Implications
Each KL grade correlates with different clinical presentations—from asymptomatic patients (KL 0) to those with significant pain, stiffness, and functional impairment (KL 3–4). These correlations help guide treatment decisions, ranging from lifestyle modifications in early disease to surgical interventions in advanced cases.

Management Strategies
Treatment approaches depend on the severity:
	•	Early Grades (0–1): Focus on prevention, lifestyle modifications, and exercise.
	•	Mild to Moderate OA (KL 2–3): Conservative management including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and intra-articular injections.
	•	Severe OA (KL 4): Advanced interventions, such as joint replacement surgery, may be necessary.

This document provides a comprehensive overview that sets the stage for understanding the more detailed descriptions in the subsequent documents.

Document 2: Detailed Document for KL Grade 0 – Normal

Radiographic Features
	•	Definition: No radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis.
	•	Findings:
	•	Normal joint space width.
	•	No osteophyte (bone spur) formation.
	•	Absence of subchondral sclerosis or cystic changes.

Clinical Correlation
	•	Symptoms:
	•	Patients typically experience no pain or stiffness related to OA.
	•	Implications:
	•	Radiographs are normal, indicating that any joint discomfort is likely due to other causes.

Management and Recommendations
	•	Preventative Advice:
	•	Encourage maintaining a healthy weight and regular exercise.
	•	No specific OA treatment is required.

Conclusion
KL Grade 0 indicates a healthy joint appearance on radiographs and suggests that preventive measures can help maintain joint health.

Document 3: Detailed Document for KL Grade 1 – Doubtful

Radiographic Features
	•	Definition: Doubtful changes that may represent early OA.
	•	Findings:
	•	Joint space appears normal or shows minimal narrowing.
	•	Possible presence of very small or “doubtful” osteophytes.
	•	No definite subchondral sclerosis or bone deformity.

Clinical Correlation
	•	Symptoms:
	•	Patients may be asymptomatic or report very mild discomfort.
	•	Implications:
	•	The changes are subtle and may not be clinically significant; however, they could represent the very early stages of degenerative change.

Management and Recommendations
	•	Monitoring:
	•	Regular follow-up with periodic radiographs can help monitor for progression.
	•	Lifestyle Adjustments:
	•	Advise on weight management, exercise, and joint care practices.
	•	Conservative Approach:
	•	No aggressive treatment is usually required at this stage.

Conclusion
KL Grade 1 is often considered “doubtful” OA, indicating subtle radiographic changes with minimal clinical impact, but it should prompt monitoring and preventive lifestyle modifications.

Document 4: Detailed Document for KL Grade 2 – Mild

Radiographic Features
	•	Definition: Definite osteophyte formation with possible joint space narrowing.
	•	Findings:
	•	Clear evidence of osteophytes at the joint margins.
	•	Joint space narrowing may be present, though not consistently pronounced.
	•	Minimal or no subchondral sclerosis.
	•	Bone contour is mostly preserved.

Clinical Correlation
	•	Symptoms:
	•	Some patients may start experiencing intermittent joint pain or stiffness, especially after activity.
	•	Implications:
	•	Indicates early osteoarthritis with structural changes that correlate with the onset of symptoms in some individuals.

Management and Recommendations
	•	Conservative Treatment:
	•	Emphasize lifestyle modifications, physical therapy, and pain management with NSAIDs.
	•	Monitoring:
	•	Follow-up assessments may be required to monitor disease progression.
	•	Patient Education:
	•	Educate patients on joint health, activity modification, and weight management.

Conclusion
KL Grade 2 represents early, definite OA where structural changes are present. At this stage, conservative treatments can help manage symptoms and potentially slow progression.

Document 5: Detailed Document for KL Grade 3 – Moderate

Radiographic Features
	•	Definition: Moderate osteoarthritic changes with multiple osteophytes and clear joint space narrowing.
	•	Findings:
	•	Multiple and larger osteophytes are present.
	•	Definite narrowing of the joint space.
	•	Subchondral sclerosis is evident.
	•	Early signs of bone-end deformity may be observed.

Clinical Correlation
	•	Symptoms:
	•	Persistent joint pain and stiffness are common.
	•	Patients often report reduced range of motion and functional impairment.
	•	Implications:
	•	This grade reflects clinically significant OA with noticeable impact on daily activities and quality of life.

Management and Recommendations
	•	Conservative Measures:
	•	Physical therapy, NSAIDs, and lifestyle modifications remain first-line interventions.
	•	Additional Interventions:
	•	Consider intra-articular injections (e.g., corticosteroids) for pain relief.
	•	Monitoring and Support:
	•	Regular assessments are necessary to evaluate symptom progression and adjust treatment accordingly.

Conclusion
KL Grade 3 indicates moderate OA with significant radiographic and symptomatic changes. Management focuses on relieving symptoms, maintaining joint function, and slowing further degeneration.

Document 6: Detailed Document for KL Grade 4 – Severe

Radiographic Features
	•	Definition: Severe osteoarthritis with extensive radiographic abnormalities.
	•	Findings:
	•	Extensive and large osteophyte formation.
	•	Marked and near‑complete loss of joint space, often described as “bone-on-bone.”
	•	Severe subchondral sclerosis.
	•	Definite deformity of the bone ends.

Clinical Correlation
	•	Symptoms:
	•	Patients frequently experience constant, severe joint pain.
	•	Marked stiffness and significant functional impairment are common.
	•	Implications:
	•	This stage represents advanced OA where structural damage is extensive and significantly affects daily activities.

Management and Recommendations
	•	Advanced Treatments:
	•	When conservative measures are no longer effective, joint replacement surgery (e.g., total knee arthroplasty) may be indicated.
	•	Multidisciplinary Approach:
	•	Combine pain management, physical therapy, and possibly surgical consultation to address the advanced disease.
	•	Patient Counseling:
	•	Provide thorough counseling on treatment options, risks, and expected outcomes.

Conclusion
KL Grade 4 is the most severe form of OA, characterized by extensive structural damage. At this stage, the focus shifts to advanced interventions to improve quality of life and alleviate debilitating symptoms.
