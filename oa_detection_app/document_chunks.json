A detailed analysis of Medicare beneficiaries\nreported the TKA annual utilization rate ranging from\n287,006 in 2006 to 301,956 in 2010 [26]. The demand for\nTKA is expected to grow exponentially over the coming\ndecades with epidemiological data suggesting a 673%\nincrease in the United States by 2030, representing 3.48\nmillion procedures annually [22].\nAs a polymorphic disease with a variety of clinical\npresentations, OA is challenging to rigorously define. A\ncommonly encountered definition of OA describes \u2018\u2018\u2026a\nheterogeneous group of conditions that leads to joint\nsymptoms and signs which are associated with defective\nintegrity of articular cartilage, in addition to related\nchanges in the underlying bone and at the joint margins\u2019\u2019\n[1]. The pathogenesis of OA is poorly understood but is\nthought to include a complex interplay among mechanical,\nbiochemical, cellular, genetic, and immunologic phenomena\n[7]. Several attempts to develop diagnostic criteria for\nOA were previously undertaken and incorporate patientreported\njoint pain in conjunction with consistent radiographic\nfindings [1, 6, 24]. OA generally can be\nsubcategorized into primary (idiopathic) and secondary OA\n[1, 25]. Common causes of secondary OA include posttraumatic,\ndysplastic, infectious, inflammatory, or\nbiochemical etiologies that are relatively well understood.\nAlthough the etiology of primary OA remains largely\nundefined, genetic factors, age-related physiological\nchanges, ethnicity, and biomechanical factors likely play\nan important role [16].\nPlain radiography remains a mainstay in the diagnosis of\nOA. The first formalized attempts at establishing a radiographic\nclassification scheme for OA were described by\nKellgren and Lawrence (KL) in 1957 [19]. After studying\nrheumatism in coal miners at the Bedford Colliery in North\nWest England [18], Kellgren investigated the inter- and\nintraobserver reliability of radiographic changes of\nrheumatism observed in the hand [17]. After concluding\nthat there was wide disagreement among different observers,\nKL endeavored to establish a classification\nscheme with an associated set of standardized radiographs\nfor OA of diarthrodial joints. They proposed a five-grade\nclassification scheme and examined plain radiographs of\neight joints including the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP),\nmetacarpophalangeal joint (MCP), first carpometacarpal\njoint (CMC), wrist, cervical spine, lumbar spine, hips, and\nknees to calculate the inter- and intraobserver reliability of\neach [19]. They found that the tibiofemoral joint of the\nknee had the highest interobserver correlation coefficient of\nr = 0.83 (range of all joints studied, 0.10\u20130.83) as well as\nthe second highest intraobserver correlation coefficient of\nEach author certifies that he or she, or a member of his or her\nimmediate family, has no funding or commercial associations (eg,\nconsultancies, stock ownership, equity interest, patent/licensing\narrangements, etc) that might pose a conflict of interest in connection\nwith the submitted article.\nAll ICMJE Conflict of Interest Forms for authors and Clinical\nOrthopaedics and Related Research1 editors and board members are\non file with the publication and can be viewed on request.\nM.

These early results\nwould predict the future application of their classification\nscheme to the knee specifically. Currently, the KL classification\nis the most widely used clinical tool for the\nradiographic diagnosis of OA [5].\nPurpose\nThe KL classification has been commonly used as a research\ntool in epidemiological studies of OA, including landmark\narticles by Felson et al. [10] in the Framingham\nOsteoarthritis Study, and Bagge et al. [3] assessing\nosteoarthritis in European populations. The KL classification\nwas also used in the development of atlases of radiographic\nfeatures of OA, including the work done by Scott et al. [33].\nThe Kellgren and Lawrence classification may also\nassist healthcare providers with a treatment algorithm to\nguide clinical decision-making, specifically defining which\npatients may benefit most from surgical management.\nFurthermore, some insurers currently require providers to\ninclude documentation of the KL classification to receive\napproval for a TKA [37, 38].\nDespite its common use, all research and clinical efforts\nusing the KL classification depend critically on rigorous\nvalidation and continuous reevaluation of the schema\u2019s\nrelevance to patient-centered outcomes.\nDescription of the Kellgren-Lawrence Classification\nSystem\nBased on the data presented in their original work, the KL\nclassification is typically applied specifically within the context\nof knee OA. The KL classification was originally\ndescribed using AP knee radiographs. Each radiograph was\nassigned a grade from 0 to 4, which they correlated to\nincreasing severity of OA, with Grade 0 signifying no presence\nof OA and Grade 4 signifying severe OA [19] (Fig. 1).\nAdditionally, KL provided detailed radiographic descriptions\nofOA(Table 1).Although it is unclear fromthe original paper\nwhether the radiographic descriptionswere presentedwith the\nintent of demonstrating a linear disease progression ofOAthat\nbegins with the formation of osteophytes and culminates in the\naltered shape of bone ends, other authors have criticized the\nKL system on the basis of this assumption [5, 27].\nValidation\nIn their original paper, KL acknowledged variability in the\nradiographic evaluation of OA and described the inter- and\nintraobserver reliability of their system [19] (Table 2). In\nparticular, the authors comment that estimates of OA\nprevalence in all joints examined vary considerably\nbetween observers (\u00b1 31% deviation from the mean\nnumber of diagnoses of OA) and less so within the same\nobserver (\u00b1 5% deviation from the mean number of\ndiagnoses of OA). The authors report the inter- and\nintraobserver reliability correlation coefficient of the knee\nto both be 0.83 and comment that, \u2018\u2018A significant correlation\nbetween the two observers was obtained for all joints\nexcept the wrist\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Two readings by the same observer\ngave only a slightly better correlation on the reading of\nindividual x rays\u2026\u2019\u2019 [19]. It is unlikely, however, that the\nauthors used the term \u2018\u2018significant\u2019\u2019 within the same statistical\ncontext that the word carries in the literature today\nbecause no p values or confidence intervals were reported\nfor their data. To determine the inter- and intraobserver\ncorrelation coefficients, KL used two observers to evaluate\na series of 510 radiographs of eight joints including the\nDIP, MCP, first CMC, wrist, cervical spine, lumbar spine,\nhips, and knees from 85 patients aged 55 to 64 years\nselected randomly from an urban population. The authors\ndid not explicitly report how many radiographs from each\njoint were used in their calculations or mention the qualifications\nor training of the two observers who graded the\nradiographs.\nMore recently, Wright [40] reevaluated the interobserver\nreliability of the KL system in addition to five other\nradiographic classification schemes used to grade knee OA\n(Table 3). The group used radiographs from 632 patients\nenrolled in the Multicenter ACL Revision Study (MARS)\nconsortium, which consisted of cohorts of patients from 83\nsurgeons from 52 sites. The investigators used three independent\nand blinded observers (specific qualifications and\ntraining not explicitly stated by authors) to grade weightbearing\nAP and/or Rosenberg radiographs (depending on\navailability) with six radiographic classification schemes.\nIn addition, their radiographic findings were compared with\narthroscopic evidence of tibiofemoral chondral disease.\nThey reported that the KL system was the most studied\namong the different classification systems and had an\ninterobserver reliability intraclass correlation coefficient of\n0.51 to 0.89 (considered \u2018\u2018moderate\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018very good\u2019\u2019 based\non the author\u2019s provided definitions) from studies since the\noriginal KL article [40]. The investigators provided their\nown interobserver reliability intraclass correlation coefficients\nusing the Rosenberg radiograph 0.54 (95%\nconfidence interval [CI], 0.48\u20130.59) and AP radiographs\n0.38 (95% CI, 0.33\u20130.43), which they characterized as\nmoderate and poor, respectively [40]. The authors provide\nan explanation for this wide range in interobserver reliability\nby suggesting that differences in technique,\npopulation age group, and degree of OA likely contributed\nVolume 474, Number 8, August 2016 Classifications in Brief 1887\n123\nto the differing results from the various studies. It is also\nlikely that variable interpretations of the KL classification\nby observers in different studies had a considerable effect\non the reliability data they reported.\nIn the 1987 study of the Framingham population by\nFelson et al.

Although the study provided\nunique population-based data using highly trained observers,\nthe authors admit that their population lacked ethnic\ndiversity by having no black, Hispanic, or non-European\nethnic groups. Given the growing ethnic diversity of the US\npopulation, it may be difficult to extrapolate the results\nfound in this study to the broader population. In later works\nby Scott et al. [33], the authors used two skeletal radiologists\nand two rheumatologists to examine 30 standing AP\nknee radiographs randomly selected by an investigator not\ninvolved in the readings from the Baltimore Longitudinal\nStudy of Aging and reported an interreader intraclass correlation\ncoefficient of 0.68 (\u2018\u2018good\u2019\u2019) and intrareader\nintraclass correlation coefficient of 0.87 (\u2018\u2018very good\u2019\u2019).\nThe authors do not provide detailed ethnic demographic\ninformation about their study population but report that\ntheir subjects consisted of 25 men and five women (ages\n42\u201384 years old, mean age of men = 67 years, mean age of\nwomen = 71 years). Both studies admit to selecting a\nsimilar number of radiographs from each KL classification\ngrade for calculating their intraclass correlation coefficients,\nwhich may provide more stable predictions of\nreliability scores but may not be as readily applicable to\nlarger populations. Another study by Gossec et al. [12]\nused 50 radiographs selected from 1759 radiographs from\nfive databases of trials or cohort studies to evaluate the\ninterreader and intrareader intraclass correlation coefficient\nof standing, extended knee radiographs using two trained\nrheumatologists and reported that the KL classification had\nan interreader intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.72\n(95% CI, 0.38\u20130.86) (\u2018\u2018good\u2019\u2019) and an intrareader intraclass\ncorrelation coefficient of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.55\u20130.83)\n(\u2018\u2018good\u2019\u2019). No criteria for the selection of the 50 radiographs\nfrom the collection of 1759 were explicitly stated by\nthe authors and it is not clear if the selection included\nrelatively equal numbers of radiographs from each KL\nclassification grade. Given the differing demographic\nmakeup of each population studied, including differences\nin ethnic group, percentage of male versus female, and age\nas well as the differing selection criteria for the radiographs\nexamined by the observers, which themselves varied in\nnumber, qualifications, and training, it is understandable\nthat the range of interobserver intraclass correlation coefficients\nfor the KL classification cited by Wright [40]\n(0.51\u20130.89) is as wide as it is.\nAlthough independent validation of the KL classification\nhas been examined by multiple authors, less is known\nabout the KL classification\u2019s diagnostic accuracy, that is\nthe degree to which the radiographic findings actually\nreflect the physical state of the joint; the best work on this\nsuggests that using the Rosenberg view (the 45\u2000 posteroanterior\nflexion weightbearing radiograph; Fig. 2 [28])\nresults in higher interrater reliability (0.54; 95% CI, 0.48\u2013\n0.59) and better correlation to arthroscopic evidence of OA\n(Spearman rho 0.42; 95% CI, 0.33\u20130.49) than does using\nthe AP radiograph (interrater reliability 0.38; 95% CI,\n0.33\u20130.43; Spearman rho 0.30; 95% CI, 0.23\u20130.38) [40].\nThose authors argue that this may be because the Rosenberg\nradiograph provides better visualization of the femoral\ncondyles in midflexion, a common site of articular surface\ndegeneration.\nLimitations\nDespite the wide application of the KL classification, the\nsystem has several noted limitations. Perhaps the most\nwidely argued criticism of the KL system is its application\nto disease progression and insensitivity to change. The KL\nsystem has been criticized by Spector and Cooper [35] for\nassuming a linear radiographic progression of OA, starting\nwith osteophyte formation, proceeding to joint space narrowing\n(JSN), and terminating in deformation of articular\nsurfaces. However, as the authors point out, JSN in the\nabsence of osteophyte formation cannot be measured in the\nKL system, which becomes problematic in patients with\nFig. 2 Diagram of how the Rosenberg radiograph would be set up\nand performed [28].

Although\nthis occurrence is thought to be less common, the presence\nof marginal osteophytes likely represents a hypertrophic\nresponse to mechanical stress in conjunction with\nenchondral ossification, which may occur along a spectrum\ndepending on individual physiology [21]. Other classification\nsystems have attempted to segregate the radiological\nfindings by performing individual evaluations of the joint\nspace for the medial and lateral compartments separately\nand doing likewise again for osteophyte formation in each\nlocation [2, 5, 27, 34]. However, these classification systems\nhave not been adopted widely, likely as a result of\nchallenges in standardizing definitions and an inherent\ndifficulty in discriminating JSN and osteophyte formation.\nIn addition, Gu\u00a8nther and Sun [13] described inferior\ninterobserver intraclass correlation coefficients for medial\ncompartment (0.62) and lateral compartment (0.47) JSN as\nwell as medial femorotibial, lateral femorotibial, and tibial\nspine osteophyte formation (0.75, 0.74, and 0.63, respectively)\nas compared with the overall KL classification score\n(0.81) when using three observers, one of whom was an\nexperienced orthopaedic surgeon and two of whom were\northopaedic residents. As discussed by Emrani et al. [8],\nclassifications based on JSN may be preferable to the KL\nsystem for monitoring progression of OA, whereas the KL\nsystem may be better for assessing severity of osteoarthritic\ndisease. A criticism of multiple classification systems (including\nthe KL) is the lack of recognition of patellofemoral\narthritis as a distinct or contributory radiographic factor.\nAnother criticism of the KL system is the inconsistency\nin its original description by the authors and variable\napplications of the classification in subsequent studies. In\ntheir original paper, KL provided simple descriptions of\neach grade, \u2018\u2018none, doubtful, minimal, moderate, severe,\u2019\u2019\nalong with radiographic features considered evidence of\nOA [19] (Table 1); however, they never explicitly specified\nwhich radiographic features correspond to which grade.\nYears after their original article, Grade 2 was changed to\n\u2018\u2018the presence of definite osteophytes with minimal joint\nspace narrowing\u2019\u2019 [20]. After that, Grade 2 was changed\nagain to \u2018\u2018definite osteophytes but the joint space is\nunimpaired\u2019\u2019 [23]. These conflicting descriptions, although\nthey were not present in the initial paper or made by its\noriginal authors, have nonetheless led to substantial confusion\namong investigators and inconsistent application.\nSchiphof et al. [30] examined epidemiological cohort\nstudies between 1966 and 2006 that incorporated the\noriginal KL criteria and found five different descriptions of\nthe KL grading system. Interestingly, some cohort studies\ncontained inconsistencies within the same article. They\nlater examined the impact of these differences in descriptions\nof the KL criteria [31] by having two trained readers\nexamine the weightbearing, extended, AP knee radiographs\nof 3071 people using the five unique descriptions. The\nauthors calculated reproducibility, agreement using the j\nstatistic, and association with patient-reported knee complaints.\nThey determined that the reproducibility of three of\nthe descriptions was \u2018\u2018good\u2019\u2019 (weighted j = 0.66, 0.69,\n0.63), whereas the reproducibility of the original description\nand a fifth description was \u2018\u2018moderate\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018poor\u2019\u2019\n(weighted j = 0.41 and 0.35, respectively). The authors\ndetermined the agreement between the original KL criteria\nand the four alternatives to be \u2018\u2018moderate\u2019\u2019 (weighted j\napproximately 0.50). The correlation to patient-reported\nknee complaints was the strongest with the original\ndescription (odds ratio [OR], 2.2 [95% CI, 1.9\u20132.7], 4.3\n[95% CI, 3.2\u20135.7], 18.3 [95% CI, 7.1\u201347.2] at Grade[1,\nGrade[2, Grade[3, respectively); however, the differences\nin OR between the original and alternative\ndescriptions were small and sometimes not significant [31].\nAdditionally, the authors admit that patient-reported knee\ncomplaints could be influenced by the presence of patellofemoral\nOA, which is not taken into account with the KL\nsystem and must be contextualized when interpreting this\ndata. The authors conclude their article with recommendations\nfor using the original description to differentiate\npatients categorized as Grade[2 (definite/mild OA) from\npatients categorized as Grade\\2 (none/possible OA) and\nto use several of the alternative descriptions to differentiate\npatients categorize as Grade 0 (no OA) from patients categorized\nas Grade 1 (possible OA). Given these results, it is\nclear that discrepancies in the description and application\nof the KL system are present in the literature; however, the\nexact impact of these differences on patient care is unclear\nand requires further investigation.\nConclusions and Uses\nAlthough the KL system has limitations, it remains widely\nused in clinical practice and in research. Like any radiographic\nclassification tool, the KL system is used ideally in\nconjunction with a thorough clinical assessment. Altman\net al. [1] proposed criteria combining the medical history,\nphysical examination, laboratory as well as radiographic\ntests to diagnose knee OA, an approach that provides a\nmore comprehensive assessment of a patient\u2019s disease state\nin comparison to the KL system alone.\nRadiographic classification systems like KL seek to\nstandardize the interpretation of studies that many clinicians\norder during an initial assessment of a patient\npresenting with clinical findings suggestive of knee OA. In\ntheir original paper, Kellgren and Lawrence intended to\ncreate a standard reference for the radiographic evaluation\nof OA for the purposes of field surveys and clinical trials.\nVolume 474, Number 8, August 2016 Classifications in Brief 1891\n123\nAlthough the KL system has been validated with respect to\ninter- and intraobserver reliability and a recent article\nsuggests high diagnostic accuracy [40], further research\napplications should likely focus on the development of\ntreatment algorithms based on classification grade.
