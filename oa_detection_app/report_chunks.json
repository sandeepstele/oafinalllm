OA remains an exciting challenge in terms of the development of this diagnosis and its disease\u2010modifying drugs, and the search for more effective treatment for OA\u2010related pain. This guideline provides practitioners with recommendations on diagnosis and treatment for people with OA.\nOn October 12, 2001, the Chinese government established a Health Ministry Fund for an Arthritis Education Program. In 2003, with this fund's support, a group of Chinese experts on orthopaedics and rheumatology were organized to draw up a draft guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of osteoarthritis. Although the published draft provided recommendations, it must be recognized that there has been considerable progress in the development of diagnosis and treatment for this disease 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 . Therefore, the draft requires extensive modification.\nThis Guideline is just an academic reference, and is to be be implemented according to the specific characteristics of patients, and the available medical equipment and environmental conditions. Please always read and follow relevant instructions before implementing any control and treatment measures.\nOverview\nOA is a joint disease characterized by fibrosis, osteophyte development, and articular cartilage damage. The exact causes of OA are unknown. However, a number of risk factors are commonly associated with the onset of the disease; these include ageing, obesity, inflammation, trauma, genetics, and other factors. The pathological features of the disorder are articular cartilage deterioration, subchondral cyst formation and bone sclerosis, osteophytes around joint margins, synovial hyperplasia, joint capsule contracture, ligament laxity or contracture, and muscle atrophy and weakness. Osteophytes or knee joint effusion may cause swelling in the joints of the hand.\nOA most commonly affects patients who are middle\u2010aged and older, and is more common in female than male patients. The prevalence rate of OA reaches 50% among the people over 60 years of age. The rate hits 80% among the people over 75 years, with a disability rate as high as 53%. OA most often affects the hands, feet, spine, and large weight bearing joints, such as the knees and hips.\nClassification\nOA can be divided into primary and secondary types. Primary OA is commonly linked to middle and old age, when cartilage failure of unknown cause develops, predisposing factors including genetic factors and physical activity. Secondary OA is due to trauma, inflammation, joint instability, developmental diseases, repetitive mechanical stress, certain metabolic dysfunctions, or congenital diseases.\nClinical manifestations\nSymptoms and physical signs\nJoint pain and pain on pressure\nIn the early stages, joint pain is intermittent and dull, and rated as mild\u2010to\u2010moderate in severity. It may improve after rest but worsen after activity and is often related to the weather. In the advanced stages, the pain can be continuous and at night. Pressure on the joint can produce pain, which tends to be more marked when there is swelling of the joint.\nJoint stiffness\nAffected joints are stiff and tight when the patient gets up in the morning. This joint stiffness, also known as morning stiffness, can be alleviated by joint activity. The symptom can last from a few to ten min, rarely lasting more than 30\u2003min. Low atmospheric pressure or high air humidity can worsen this symptom.\nJoint swelling\nObvious swelling and deformation in the hand joints are often observed. Bony nodules may develop at the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints (called Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes, respectively).\nBony crepitation (fremitus)\nThere is bony crepitation (fremitus) during movement of the joint if the cartilage surface is damaged or has become rough. Typically, this symptom presents in OA of the knee.\nMuscle weakness and impairment of movement\nMuscle weakness around the affected joint is a common finding. Loss of strength in the muscles supporting the joint and impairment of surrounding soft tissue lead to uncoordinated movements which overstress the joint.\nLaboratory tests\nThere is no definitive laboratory test for the diagnosis of OA. Routine blood test results are normal. Results of protein electrophoresis and values for immune complexes, complement, and so on are within the normal range. An OA patient with synovitis may have a slight increase in serum C\u2010creative protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).\nRadiology\nPlain film radiographic findings include asymmetrical narrow joint spaces, subchondral sclerosis, bone cysts, osteophytosis, and hyperosteogeny at the joint margins. Loose bodies or dysarthrosis can be observed in some cases.\nEssentials of diagnosis\nDiagnosis of OA is based on the symptoms, physical signs, X\u2010ray manifestations and laboratory tests. A flow chart is proposed to aid the diagnosis (Fig.\u20031). The proposed diagnostic criteria for OA of the knee and hip joints are listed in 1, 2, respectively.\nFigure 1.\nFigure 1\nOpen in a new tab\nFlow chart for diagnosis and evaluation of OA.\nTable 1.\nDiagnostic criteria for OA in the knee joint\nNumber\tCharacteristics\n1\tRecurrent knee joint pain in the last month.\n2\tNarrowed joint space, subchondral cyst formation and bone sclerosis, or osteophytosis around joint margin on the radiographs in standing or load position.\n3\tEvidence of clear, transparent, and viscous joint effusion at least twice; white cell count <2000/ml.\n4\tMiddle\u2010aged and aged patients (40 years old or older).\n5\tMorning stiffness \u226430\u2003min.\n6\tPalpable bone crepitation (fremitus) on movement of joint.\nOpen in a new tab\nNote: Diagnosis of knee OA can be made if the following conditions are satisfied: 1 + 2, 1 + 3 + 5 + 6 or 1 + 4 + 5 + 6.\nTable 2.\nDiagnostic criteria for OA in the hip joint\nNumber\tCharacteristics\n1\tRecurrent hip joint pain in the last month.\n2\tESR \u226420\u2003mm/h.\n3\tOsteophytosis and hyperplasia in the acetabular margin on radiograph.\n4\tA narrowed hip joint space on plain radiograph.\nOpen in a new tab\nNote: Diagnosis of hip OA can be made if the following conditions are satisfied: 1 + 2 + 3 or 1 + 3 + 4.\nTreatment\nThere is still no cure for OA. However, treatment can reduce pain, correct deformities, and improve joint function so as to improve the quality of the patient's life. A combination of non\u2010drug and drug treatments is superior to drug treatment alone. Surgical treatment is appropriate when conservative therapy fails, or is inadequate. Treatment regimens should be chosen according to age, gender, body weight, risk factors, lesion site and severity, and expectations of the treatment.\nNon\u2010drug treatment\nNon\u2010drug treatment should always be initiated first, especially for patients with mild OA. Many options exist for individuals with the disorder. Some of the most common are briefly described below.\nPatient education\nEducation programs should be designed to provide patients with information about behavioural changes which could benefit them (such as avoiding inappropriate activities, exercise, postures, or stair climbing, as well as avoiding running, jumping or crouching for long periods of time), body weight reduction, aerobic exercise (such as swimming and bicycling), joint exercises (such as non\u2010weight\u2010bearing knee flexion and extension to maintain a maximum range of movement in the joint), and muscle strength training (such as training the abductor muscles of hip joint).\nPhysiotherapy\nThe main goal of physiotherapy is to increase local blood circulation and reduce inflammatory reactions. Physiotherapies include thermotherapy, hydrotherapy, ultrasound therapy, acupuncture, massage, traction, and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation.\nUse of supportive devices\nA hand crutch, walking stick, or walking frame can be used to reduce weight bearing of the affected joint during walking.\nChange of weight\u2010bearing line\nOrthoses or orthopaedic shoes designed for correcting varus or valgus deformity can be used to change weight\u2010bearing patterns in the lower extremity.\nDrug treatment\nIf non\u2010drug treatment is ineffective, drug treatment should be conducted according to the severity of joint pain.\nTopical drug treatment\nIn the treatment of hand and knee OA, topical treatment is recommended prior to administration of oral medications. Non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drug (NSAID) emulsions, pastes, patches, and liniments can effectively alleviate mild to moderate joint pain with minimal adverse reactions. Topical and oral NSAIDs can be used in combination to relieve moderate to severe pain.\nSystemic analgesics\nVarious routes of administration are available, including oral, parenteral and rectal routes.\nMedication principles: (i) Prior to administration of drugs, patient\u2010related risk factors such as other medical conditions should be assessed. (ii) Dosage should be individualized according to the characteristics of the patient. (iii) As far as possible, the minimum effective dose should be prescribed, and excessive and repeated doses, as well as use of more than one drug in the same category, should be avoided. (iv) Three months after drug administration, routine blood and stool tests, stool occult blood tests, and hepatic and renal function tests should be performed selectively according to the patient's individual characteristics.\nDrug selection: (i) Paracetamol is recommended as the first line drug for pain relief in OA, the maximum daily dose should not exceed 4000\u2003mg. (ii) If paracetamol provides inadequate pain relief, NSAIDs (Table\u20033) can be used on patients who are not at high risk on the basis of gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal or cardiovascular diseases. There are two main types of NSAIDs; non\u2010selective NSAIDs and selective cyclo\u2010oxygenase\u20102 (COX\u20102) inhibitors. As different types of NSAIDs have different efficacies and adverse reactions, oral administration of these drugs should be adjusted according to individual patient risk factors, and patient and drug characteristics (Table\u20034). Selective COX\u20102 inhibitors or non\u2010selective NSAIDs plus gastric mucosal protective agents, such as histamine (H2) receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors or misoprostol, can be of benefit in patients at high risk of adverse gastrointestinal reactions. (iii) Other analgesic drugs, such as tramadol, opioid analgesics, and paracetamol compounds, can be used if NSAIDs are ineffective or poorly tolerated.\nTable 3.\nCommon NSAIDs for OA treatment\nDrugs\tHalf\u2010life (h)\tTotal dosage\tDosage / dose\tTimes /day\nPropionic acid derivatives\t\t\t\t\n\u2003Ibuprofen\t2\t1200\u20132400\u2003mg\t400\u2013600\u2003mg\t3\u20134\n\u2003Naproxen\t14\t500\u20131000\u2003mg\t250\u2013500\u2003mg\t2\n\u2003Loxoprofen\t1.2\t180\u2003mg\t60\u2003mg\t3\nBenzoyl acid derivatives\t\t\t\t\n\u2003Diclofenac\t2\t75\u2013150\u2003mg\t25\u201350\u2003mg\t2\u20133\nIndolyl acids\t\t\t\t\n\u2003Sulindac\t18\t400\u2003mg\t200\u2003mg\t2\n\u2003Acemetacin\t3\t90\u2013180\u2003mg\t30\u201360\u2003mg\t3\nPyronecarboxylic acids\t\t\t\t\n\u2003Etodolac\t8.3\t400\u20131000\u2003mg\t400\u20131000\u2003mg\t1\nNon\u2010acids\t\t\t\t\n\u2003Nabumetone\t24\t1000\u20132000\u2003mg\t1000\u2003mg\t1\u20132\nXicams\t\t\t\t\n\u2003Meloxicam\t20\t7.5\u201315\u2003mg\t7.5\u201315\u2003mg\t1\nSulfonanilides\t\t\t\t\n\u2003Nimesulide\t2\u20135\t400\u2003mg\t100\u2013200\u2003mg\t2\nCoxibs\t\t\t\t\n\u2003Cimicoxib\t11\t200\u2003mg\t100\u2013200\u2003mg\t1\u20132\nOther analgesics\t\t\t\t\n\u2003Tramadol amino\u2010phenol\t6\u20137\t3\u20136 tablets\t1\u20132 tablets\t2\u20133\n\u2003Tramadol hydrochloride\t6\u20137\t3\u20136 tablets\t1\u20132 tablets\t2\u20133\nOpen in a new tab\nTable 4.\nHigh risk factors for NSAIDs\nNumber\tHigh\u2010risk of upper gastrointestinal complications\tHigh\u2010risk of heart, brain, and kidney complications\n1\tOver 65 years of age\tOver 65 years of age\n2\tLong\u2010term administration of NSAIDs\tPast history of cerebrovascular disease (stroke or transient cerebral ischemia attack)\n3\tReceiving an oral glucocorticoid\tHistory of cerebrovascular disease\n4\tHistory of upper gastrointestinal ulcer or bleeding\tHistory of renal disease\n5\tUsing anticoagulant drugs\tUsing ACEI and hydragogue simultaneously\n6\tHistory of alcoholism\tPerioperative period of a CABG (the use of NSAIDs is contraindicated)\nOpen in a new tab\nACEI, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; CABG, coronary artery bypass grafting.\nInjection into the articular space\n(i) When oral drugs have resulted in inadequate pain relief, the viscoelastic extender sodium hyaluronate can be injected into the articular cavity after draining the joint fluid. (ii) Where NSAIDs are poorly tolerated or the treatment is ineffective after 4\u20136 weeks of treatment, a glucocorticoid can be injected into the articular cavity. Because articular cartilage damage can be worsened by constant use of glucocorticoids, injection should not be performed more than three to four times a year.\nMedications which help to improve the disease condition and cartilage\u2010protective agents\nMedications such as diacerein, dextrosamine, avocado soybean unsaponifiables, and doxycycline can slow down the course of the disease and improve the patients' symptoms to a certain degree. Diacerein plays a role in regulating or adjusting joint structure.\nSurgical treatment\nWhen conservative measures fail to control pain and improve joint function, surgery can be considered. Surgical intervention may assist in making the diagnosis or be an integral part of the whole treatment process.\nSurgery is aimed at alleviating or even eliminating pain, preventing or correcting malformation, preventing worsening joint damage, and improving joint function.\nThere are various options for surgical treatment of OA, including extirpation of loose bodies, arthrotomy and joint debridement, osteotomy, joint fusion, and artificial joint replacement.\nThe advantages of arthroscopy over traditional open surgery are the small incisions required and the ability to safely inspect the joint.\n1. Demographic and Anthropometric Parameters", "AGE\nTypical Range: Approximately 40 to 80+ years in OA studies.\nHow It Affects OA:\nYounger (<40 years): OA is less common, though early-onset cases do occur.\nOlder (60+ years): With advancing age, cartilage and joint tissues lose resilience, making OA more likely and often more severe.\nHEIGHT\nTypical Range: Roughly 150 cm to 200 cm (varies by population and sex).\nHow It Affects OA:\nHeight itself is not a direct risk factor but is critical for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI).\nVariations in height may also affect joint alignment and biomechanics, indirectly influencing OA risk.\nWEIGHT\nTypical Range: Can range widely, approximately 40 kg to over 150 kg.\nHow It Affects OA:\nHigher weight increases mechanical stress on weight-bearing joints (especially the knees), accelerating cartilage wear.\nExcess weight is a strong modifiable risk factor for both the development and progression of OA.\nMAX WEIGHT\nTypical Range: Reflects the patient\u2019s highest lifetime weight; values can be similar to current weight ranges.\nHow It Affects OA:\nA history of higher maximum weight implies prolonged joint loading over time, which can contribute to more significant joint degeneration.\nBMI (Body Mass Index)\nTypical Ranges:\nNormal: 18.5\u201324.9\nOverweight: 25\u201329.9\nObese: 30 and above\nHow It Affects OA:\nElevated BMI increases the load on joints and is linked to systemic inflammation.\nIndividuals with a BMI over 30 are at significantly higher risk for OA progression, especially in the knees.\n2. Clinical Symptoms and Functional Measures", "FREQUENT PAIN\nTypical Range:\nWhen measured on a numerical rating scale: 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain)\nAlternatively, it may be recorded as a binary indicator (0 = no, 1 = yes).\nHow It Affects OA:\nHigher pain scores or frequent pain reports correlate with greater symptom severity and functional limitations.\nPersistent, high-level pain often signals advanced joint degeneration.\nSURGERY\nTypical Range: Usually a binary indicator: 0 (no surgery) or 1 (surgery performed).\nHow It Affects OA:\nA history of joint surgery often reflects advanced disease or previous joint injury.\nPrior surgical intervention can also affect current joint stability and influence further treatment planning.\nRISK\nTypical Range: Depends on the risk model used; it might be expressed as:\nA probability (e.g., 0 to 1)\nA percentage (e.g., 0% to 100%)\nA numerical score (e.g., 0 to 10)\nHow It Affects OA:\nA higher risk score indicates a greater likelihood of disease progression or more severe OA.\nThis parameter aids in early identification and tailored intervention strategies.\nSXKOA (Symptomatic Knee Osteoarthritis)\nTypical Range: Usually binary: 0 (absence) or 1 (presence).\nHow It Affects OA:\nThe presence of symptomatic OA confirms that radiographic changes are associated with clinical symptoms, impacting treatment decisions.\nSWELLING\nTypical Range: Often graded on an ordinal scale, for example:\n0 = None\n1 = Mild\n2 = Moderate\n3 = Severe\nHow It Affects OA:\nIncreased swelling signals joint inflammation and effusion.\nMore pronounced swelling is often associated with greater pain and restricted joint movement.\nBENDING FULLY\nTypical Range: Measured as the joint\u2019s range of motion (e.g., degrees of knee flexion).\nNormal Knee Flexion: Approximately 135\u2013150 degrees.\nReduced Motion: Values below 120 degrees can indicate significant impairment.\nHow It Affects OA:\nInability to bend fully reflects joint stiffness and may point to advanced cartilage loss and structural damage.\nLimited range of motion affects daily activities and quality of life.\nSYMPTOMATIC\nTypical Range: Generally binary: 0 (asymptomatic) or 1 (symptomatic), or sometimes graded by severity.\nHow It Affects OA:\nThe presence of symptoms (pain, stiffness, swelling) guides the clinical management approach.\nSymptomatic patients are more likely to require active intervention compared to those who are asymptomatic.\nCREPITUS\nTypical Range:\nCan be a binary indicator (present/absent) or graded on a scale (e.g., 0 = none, 1\u20133 = increasing severity).\nHow It Affects OA:\nCrepitus, the crackling or grating sound during movement, is indicative of irregular joint surfaces and cartilage damage.\nHigher crepitus levels generally correlate with more severe joint degeneration.\nKOOS PAIN SCORE\nTypical Range:\nGenerally from 0 to 100.\nNote: Depending on the scoring method, a higher score can either mean less pain (if 100 is the best outcome) or more pain (if the scale is reversed). Most commonly, 100 indicates minimal symptoms.\nHow It Affects OA:\nLower scores (when 100 is optimal) indicate more severe pain and functional limitations, which directly influence treatment decisions and quality of life.\n3. Radiographic and Structural Parameters", "These parameters assess the joint\u2019s structural changes using standardized scoring systems (commonly on an ordinal scale):", "Osteophytes and Joint Space Narrowing\nParameters: osteophytes_y, jsn_y\nTypical Range: Usually scored from 0 to 3 (occasionally 0 to 4):\n0: No abnormality\n1: Mild changes\n2: Moderate changes\n3: Severe changes\nHow It Affects OA:\nOsteophytes: Higher scores indicate more extensive bony spur formation, a sign of the joint\u2019s attempt to stabilize after cartilage loss.\nJoint Space Narrowing (JSN): A higher JSN score reflects significant cartilage thinning and is a key marker of OA severity.\nDetailed Compartmental Scores\nParameters: osfl, scfl, cyfl, ostm, sctm, cytm, attm, osfm, scfm, cyfm, ostl, sctl, cytl, attl\nTypical Range: Also generally scored on an ordinal scale from 0 (normal) to 3 (severe abnormality).\nHow They Affect OA:\nPrefixes:\n\"os\": Often denotes osteophytes in specific compartments.\n\"sc\": May refer to subchondral changes, such as sclerosis or cyst formation.\n\"cy\": Could relate to cartilage status or cyst presence.\n\"att\": Might denote attrition or bone wear.\nSuffixes:\n\"fl\", \"fm\", \"tm\", \"tl\": Typically indicate the location within the joint (e.g., femoral lateral, femoral medial, tibial medial, tibial lateral).\nImpact:\nHigher scores in these parameters indicate more pronounced structural damage within specific joint compartments.\nSuch detailed scoring helps clinicians and researchers pinpoint areas of degeneration, tailor interventions (such as targeted physical therapy or surgical planning), and monitor disease progression over time.\nOverall Impact on OA", "Disease Severity and Progression:\nDemographic factors (age, BMI, weight history) set the stage for risk. Older age and higher BMI predispose patients to faster or more severe joint degeneration.\nSymptom measures (pain frequency, swelling, range of motion, KOOS score) directly reflect how much OA is affecting a patient\u2019s daily life.\nRadiographic scores provide objective evidence of structural joint damage, which often correlates with\u2014but does not always perfectly match\u2014symptom severity.\nManagement Implications:\nMild Cases: Lower scores across these parameters (e.g., normal BMI, minimal pain, and low radiographic scores) might be managed with conservative treatments like lifestyle changes and physical therapy.\nAdvanced Cases: Higher scores (e.g., BMI in the obese range, severe pain on a 0\u201310 scale, restricted range of motion, and radiographic scores of 2\u20133) often indicate advanced disease, necessitating more aggressive interventions such as surgical consultation or targeted pharmacotherapy.\n1. Initial Assessment and Goal Setting\nComprehensive Evaluation:\nMedical Assessment: A physician or physical therapist should assess joint range of motion, pain levels, strength, stability, gait, and functional limitations.\nImaging & History: Review any imaging studies (e.g., X-rays) and the patient\u2019s history (including weight, previous injuries, or surgeries) to determine the extent of joint damage.\nGoal Setting:\nSet realistic, patient-specific goals such as reducing pain, improving mobility, enhancing strength, and maintaining independence in daily activities.\n2. Pain and Inflammation Management\nModalities:\nIce/Heat Therapy: Apply ice to reduce inflammation during flare-ups, and use heat to relax stiff muscles during periods of low inflammation.\nElectrotherapy: Techniques like Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) can help manage pain.\nMedications:\nUse over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other pain relievers as prescribed by a healthcare provider.\nActivity Modification:\nLearn to pace activities and take regular breaks to avoid overloading the joint.\n3. Education and Self-Management\nUnderstanding OA:\nEducate the patient about OA, emphasizing that while the condition is chronic, symptoms can be managed through lifestyle and exercise.\nJoint Protection Strategies:\nTeach proper body mechanics and ergonomics to reduce stress on the joints during daily activities.\nUse of Assistive Devices:\nIncorporate devices such as canes, walkers, or braces if necessary to offload stress from affected joints.\n4. Physical Therapy Interventions\nRange of Motion (ROM) Exercises:\nStretching: Gentle stretching exercises help maintain or improve joint flexibility. For instance, hamstring stretches and calf stretches can be beneficial for knee OA.\nStrengthening Exercises:\nTargeted Muscle Training: Focus on strengthening muscles around the affected joint. For knee OA, strengthening the quadriceps, hamstrings, and hip muscles is key.\nExamples:\nStraight Leg Raises: Improve quadriceps strength without putting excessive load on the knee.\nWall Squats or Partial Squats: Begin with partial squats to gradually build lower body strength.\nAerobic Conditioning:\nLow-Impact Activities: Walking, cycling, or using an elliptical machine can enhance cardiovascular health without excessive joint stress.\nAquatic Exercises: Water aerobics or swimming reduce joint loading while allowing effective exercise.\nBalance and Proprioception Training:\nExercises such as single-leg stands or using balance boards help improve stability, which can reduce the risk of falls.\n5. Weight Management and Nutrition\nWeight Loss:\nFor overweight individuals, even modest weight loss can significantly reduce the mechanical load on weight-bearing joints (like the knees and hips).\nNutritional Guidance:\nConsider consulting a nutritionist to develop a balanced diet plan that supports overall health and may help reduce inflammation.\n6. Activity Modification and Ergonomic Adjustments\nDaily Activity Adjustments:\nModify or substitute activities that place undue stress on affected joints. For example, using a stool or bench to sit while doing tasks that involve prolonged standing.\nAdaptive Equipment:\nUse supportive footwear, orthotics, or padded insoles to reduce joint impact during walking or standing.\n7. Progressive Exercise Program\nGradual Progression:\nStart with low-intensity exercises and slowly increase the duration and intensity based on tolerance. The progression should be guided by symptom levels and improvement in function.\nMonitoring and Feedback:\nMaintain a log of exercise activities and symptoms to track progress and adjust the program as needed.\n8. Adjunctive Therapies\nComplementary Treatments:\nAcupuncture or Tai Chi: Some patients may benefit from these approaches, which can improve pain management and balance.\nManual Therapy:\nTechniques performed by a physical therapist, such as joint mobilization or massage, can help reduce stiffness and improve movement.\n9. Regular Follow-Up and Reassessment\nOngoing Evaluation:\nPeriodic reassessments by a healthcare provider or physical therapist are essential to monitor progress, address new challenges, and modify the rehabilitation plan as necessary.\nLong-Term Maintenance:\nDevelop a sustainable home exercise program to help maintain joint function and reduce the risk of future flare-ups.\n10. Psychological and Social Support\nCounseling and Support Groups:\nChronic pain and functional limitations can impact mental health. Access to counseling, support groups, or stress management workshops can be a valuable part of rehabilitation.\nPatient Empowerment:\nEncourage active participation in treatment decisions and self-management strategies, which can improve adherence and outcomes.\nContinuing Education Activity", "Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis in the world.

It can be classified into 2 categories: primary osteoarthritis and secondary osteoarthritis. Classically, osteoarthritis presents with joint pain and loss of function; however, the disease is clinically very variable and can present merely as an asymptomatic incidental finding to a devastating and permanently disabling disorder.[1][2][3]", "Go to:\nEtiology", "Risk factors for developing osteoarthritis include age, female gender, obesity, anatomical factors, muscle weakness, and joint injury (occupation/sports activities). Primary osteoarthritis is the most common subset of the disease. It is diagnosed in the absence of a predisposing trauma or disease but is associated with the risk factors listed above. Secondary osteoarthritis occurs with a preexisting joint abnormality. Predisposing conditions include trauma or injury, congenital joint disorders, inflammatory arthritis, avascular necrosis, infectious arthritis, Paget disease, osteopetrosis, osteochondritis dissecans, metabolic disorders (hemochromatosis, Wilson\u2019s disease), hemoglobinopathy, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or Marfan syndrome.[4][5]", "Go to:\nEpidemiology", "Osteoarthritis affects about 3.3 to 3.6% of the population globally. It causes moderate to severe disability in 43 million people, making it the 11th most debilitating disease worldwide. In the United States, it is estimated that 80% of the population over 65 years old has radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis, although only 60% of this subset has symptoms. This is because radiographic osteoarthritis is at least twice as common as symptomatic osteoarthritis. Therefore, radiographic changes do not prove that osteoarthritis is the cause of the patient\u2019s joint pain. In 2011, there were almost 1 million hospitalizations for osteoarthritis, with an aggregate cost of nearly $15 billion, making it the second most expensive disease seen in the United States.[1][3]", "Go to:\nPathophysiology", "Osteoarthritis is a disease of the entire joint, sparing no tissues. The cause of osteoarthritis is an interplay of risk factors (mentioned above), mechanical stress, and abnormal joint mechanics. The combination leads to pro-inflammatory markers and proteases that eventually mediate joint destruction. The complete pathway that leads to the destruction of the entire joint is unknown. Usually, the earliest changes that occur in osteoarthritis are at the level of the articular cartilage, which develops surface fibrillation, irregularity, and focal erosions. These erosions eventually extend down to the bone and continually expand to involve more of the joint surface. On a microscopic level, the collagen matrix is damaged after cartilage injury, causing chondrocytes to proliferate and form clusters. A phenotypic change to hypertrophic chondrocyte occurs, causing cartilage outgrowths that ossify and form osteophytes. As more of the collagen matrix is damaged, chondrocytes undergo apoptosis. Improperly mineralized collagen causes subchondral bone thickening; bone cysts infrequently occur in advanced disease. Even rarer, bony erosions appear in erosive osteoarthritis. There is also some synovial inflammation and hypertrophy, although this is not the inciting factor as with inflammatory arthritis. Soft-tissue structures (ligaments, joint capsule, menisci) are also affected. In end-stage osteoarthritis, calcium phosphate and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals are present. Their role is unclear, but they are thought to contribute to synovial inflammation.[6][7][8]", "Go to:\nHistory and Physical", "The presentation and progression of osteoarthritis vary greatly from person to person. The triad of symptoms of osteoarthritis is joint pain, stiffness, and locomotor restriction. Patients can also present with muscle weakness and balance issues. Pain is typically related to activity and resolves with rest. In those patients in whom the disease progresses, pain is more continuous and begins to affect activities of daily living, eventually causing severe limitations in function. Patients may also experience bony swelling, joint deformity, and instability (patients complain that the joint is \u201cgiving way\u201d or \u201cbuckling,\u201d a sign of muscle weakness). Osteoarthritis typically affects proximal and distal interphalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal joints, hips, knees, first metatarsophalangeal joints, and lower cervical and lumbar spine joints. Osteoarthritis can be monoarticular or polyarticular in the presentation. Joints can be at different stages of disease progression. Typical exam findings in osteoarthritis include bony enlargement, crepitus, effusions (non-inflammatory), and a limited range of motions. Tenderness may be present at joint lines, and there may be pain upon passive motion. Classic physical exam findings in hand osteoarthritis include Heberden\u2019s nodes (posterolateral swellings of distal interphalangeal joints), Bouchard\u2019s nodes (posterolateral swellings of PIP joints), and \u201csquaring\u201d at the base of the thumb (first carpometacarpal joints). See Image. Osteoarthritis, Hand.", "Go to:\nEvaluation", "A thorough history and physical exam (with a focused musculoskeletal exam) should be performed on all patients, with some findings summarized above. Osteoarthritis is a clinical diagnosis and can be diagnosed with confidence if the following are present: 1) pain worse with activity and better with rest, 2) age more than 45 years, 3) morning stiffness lasting less than 30 minutes, 4) bony joint enlargement, and 5) limitation in range of motion. A differential diagnosis should include rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, crystalline arthritis, hemochromatosis, bursitis, avascular necrosis, tendinitis, and radiculopathy, among other soft tissue abnormalities.[9][10] Blood tests such as complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibody test are usually normal in osteoarthritis. However, they may be ordered to rule out inflammatory arthritis. If the synovial fluid is obtained, the white blood cell count should be less than 2000/microL, predominantly mononuclear cells (non-inflammatory), which is consistent with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis.", "X-rays of the affected joint can show findings consistent with osteoarthritis, such as marginal osteophytes, joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and cysts; however, radiographic findings do not correlate to the severity of the disease and may not be present early in the disease. MRI is not routinely indicated for osteoarthritis workup; however, it can detect osteoarthritis at earlier stages than normal radiographs. Ultrasound can also identify synovial inflammation, effusion, and osteophytes, which can be related to osteoarthritis. There are several classification systems for osteoarthritis. In general, they include the effects on joints, the age of onset, radiographic appearance, presumed etiology (primary vs secondary), and rate of progression. The American College of Rheumatology classification is the most widely used classification system. At this time, it is not possible to predict which patients progress to severe osteoarthritis and which patients have their disease arrest at earlier stages.", "Go to:\nTreatment / Management", "Treatment goals for osteoarthritis are to minimize both pain and functional loss. Comprehensive management of the disease involves both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. Typically, the former can manage patients with mild symptoms, while more advanced diseases need a combination of both.[11][12][13] Mainstays for non-pharmacologic therapy include 1) avoidance of activities exacerbating pain or overloading the joint, 2) exercise to improve strength, 3) weight loss, and 4) occupational therapy for unloading joints via brace, splint, cane, or crutch. Weight loss is a critical intervention in those who are overweight and obese; each pound of weight loss can decrease the load across the knee 3 to 6-fold. Formal physical therapy can immensely assist patients in using equipment such as canes appropriately while also instructing them on exercises. Exercise programs combining aerobic and resistance training have been shown to decrease pain and improve physical function in multiple trials and should be encouraged by physicians regularly. Malalignment of joints should be corrected via mechanical means such as realignment knee brace or orthotics.", "Pharmacotherapy of osteoarthritis involves oral, topical, or intraarticular options. Acetaminophen and oral NSAIDs are the most popular and affordable options for osteoarthritis and are usually the initial choice of pharmacologic treatment. NSAIDs are usually prescribed orally or topically and, initially, should be started as needed rather than scheduled. Due to gastrointestinal toxicity and renal and cardiovascular side effects, oral NSAIDs should be used very cautiously with close monitoring long term. Topical NSAIDs are less efficacious than their oral counterparts but offer fewer gastrointestinal and other systemic side effects; however, they often cause local skin irritation.", "Intraarticular joint injections can also be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis, especially in a setting of acute pain. Glucocorticoid injections have a variable response, and there is ongoing controversy regarding repeated injections. Hyaluronic acid injections are another option, but their efficacy over placebo is also controversial. Notably, there is no role for oral glucocorticoids. Duloxetine has modest efficacy in osteoarthritis; opioids can be used in those patients without an adequate response to the above and who may not be candidates for surgery or refuse it altogether.", "It is important to note that patients vary greatly in their response to treatment, and there is a large component of trial and error in selecting the most effective agents. In those patients, specifically with knee or hip osteoarthritis, who have failed multiple non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment modalities, surgery is the next option. Failure rates for both knee and hip replacements are quite low, and they can provide pain relief and increased functionality. The timing of surgery is key to predicting success. Very poor functional status and considerable muscle weakness may not lead to improved postoperative functional status versus those undergoing surgery earlier in the disease course.[14][15]", "Go to:\nDifferential Diagnosis", "The differential diagnosis for osteoarthritis includes:", "Rheumatoid arthritis\nPsoriatic arthritis\nCrystalline arthritis\nBursitis\nTendinitis\nHemochromatosis\nAvascular necrosis\nRadiculopathy\nOther soft-tissue conditions\nGo to:\nPrognosis", "The prognosis for osteoarthritis patients depends on which joints are affected and the level of symptomatology and functional impairment. Some patients remain relatively unaffected by osteoarthritis, while others can experience severe disability. In some cases, joint replacement surgery offers the best long-term outcome.", "Go to:\nComplications", "The complications that can manifest with osteoarthritis include:", "Pain\nFalls\nDifficulty ambulation\nJoint malalignment\nDecreased range of motion of the joint\nRadiculopathies\nGo to:\nPostoperative and Rehabilitation Care", "Lifestyle changes - especially enrollment in exercise and weight reduction.", "Go to:\nDeterrence and Patient Education", "The clinical team needs to explain the etiology and pathophysiology of the arthritic process and outline the plan for intervention, which varies significantly based on the degree of pathology, joints affected, level of dysfunction, patient age, expectations for future activities, and what is therapeutically possible. Compliance with medication, weight loss, and exercise/physical therapy routines must be stressed.", "Go to:\nEnhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes", "Osteoarthritis is a chronic progressive disorder that affects millions of people with advancing age. The condition has no cure and is managed by a team of healthcare professionals that includes an internist, radiologist, endocrinologist, orthopedic surgeon, and rheumatologist. The nurse, pharmacist, and physical therapist are also integral interprofessional healthcare team members. Only through cohesive activity and communication involving all healthcare disciplines are optimal results achievable. Patients with osteoarthritis require education on the disease's natural history and understanding of their treatment options. Obese patients need a dietary consult and enroll in an exercise program. Evidence shows that water-based activities can help relieve symptoms and improve joint function; hence, consultation with a physical therapist is recommended. Further, many of these patients may benefit from a walking aid. Patients with pain should become familiar with the types of drugs and supplements available and their potential adverse effects. Only through the education of the patient can the morbidity of this disorder be decreased.[16][17][18]", "Evidence-Based Outcomes", "The prognosis for osteoarthritis patients depends on the joint involved, how many joints are involved, and the severity. There is no cure for osteoarthritis, and all the currently available treatments are directed towards reducing symptoms. Factors associated with the rapid progression of the disease include obesity, advanced age, multiple joint involvement, and the presence of varus deformity. Patients who undergo joint replacement tend to have a good prognosis with success rates of over 80%. However, most prosthetic joints wear out in 10 to 15 years, and repeat surgery is required. Also important is that patients must undergo preoperative workup as the post-surgical complications can be serious and disabling.[19][20][21]"]
